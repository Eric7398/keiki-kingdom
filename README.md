# Website for Keiki Kingdom INC
This website is structured with the goal of being creative, kids friendly, and informative. By using React I was able to create a single page application for fast loading time and a seemless user experience. I faced challenges with finding ways to add creative elements such as parallax footer and particle effects. Features that I wish to improve on and implement in the future include better code optimization and image size decrease to better optimize bandwidth.
